<p>I &#39;deployed&#39; this site today to <a href="http://www.claybinion.com/">http://www.claybinion.com</a>. It was a lot simpler than I was anticipating. I was a little worried, since I&#39;ve been using the &#39;jekyll serve&#39; command from the cmd prompt to view/test the site up until this point. Not really knowing what it&#39;s doing, I figured some sort of service was running as a webserver, but wasn&#39;t sure if there was another service, uhh serving, the html files and rendering the <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid</a> code. </p>

<p>It seems &#39;jekyll build&#39; command does what seems obvious now, but wasn&#39;t yesterday. It builds the static pages from what&#39;s in the _posts directory and other sub folders while templating out from the _layouts folder. I&#39;m guessing the build command uses the <a href="http://liquidmarkup.org/">Liquid templating language</a>, and uses .html files from _layouts to template out the page and post layouts. Don&#39;t take any of this as fact, just all my perception from my testing and reading.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used <a href="http://www.github.com/">GitHub</a>, along with their stupidly simple <a href="http://windows.github.com/">GUI desktop application</a>, to create a repository containg the source code for this site. I plan to use <a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Git-Basics">this</a> tutorial/book to begin the process of learning shell/terminal and hopefully the mindset or theory behind Git. I will be using this site as my guinea pig on this venture. This is very long over due.</p>
