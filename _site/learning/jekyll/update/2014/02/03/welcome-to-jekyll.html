<p>As the title says, I&#39;m being welcomed to jekyll. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve trashed a bootstrap basic site I had built using yeoman. I was attempting to learn how to accomplish that while also attempting to learn Version Control/SCM with <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>, <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Sourcetree</a>, and <a href="http://www.bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a>. It became a little confusing attempting to learn both things I once. So I ditched the static site for a jekyll site becuase I read <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1wwp1u/goodbye_wordpress_2014_will_be_the_year_of_the/">this article</a>. I had heard about <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> from some where at some time. Why the hell not, this time I&#39;m just doing this. No git for the time being, that can come later whenever I actually delpoy this to claybinion.com.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what was in the README before I scrapped everything, quasi-blog.</p>

<p>I&#39;m trying to figure out/learn a workflow for creating websites. I&#39;m using <a href="http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">Sourcetree</a> as a GUI to begin using BitBucket to learn subversioning(?).  I will soon be testing out bootstrap to create a sort of portfolio. Yo - Bower - Grunt will be assiting in scaffolding out this web app. I need to look into why they call it a web app, what is the defining feature to be called an app. I&#39;m learning this Yeoman stack as well, so this is mostly all new besides editing the HTML/CSS/JS. So this will be a learning experience. And so far this is just for me to look at.</p>
