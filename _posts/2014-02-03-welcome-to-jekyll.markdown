As the title says, I'm being welcomed to jekyll. 

I've trashed a bootstrap basic site I had built using yeoman. I was attempting to learn how to accomplish that while also attempting to learn Version Control/SCM with [Git][git], [Sourcetree][sourcetree], and [BitBucket][bitBucket]. It became a little confusing attempting to learn both things I once. So I ditched the static site for a jekyll site becuase I read [this article][0]. I had heard about [Jekyll][jekyll] from some where at some time. Why the hell not, this time I'm just doing this. No git for the time being, that can come later whenever I actually delpoy this to claybinion.com.

Here's what was in the README before I scrapped everything, quasi-blog.

I'm trying to figure out/learn a workflow for creating websites. I'm using [Sourcetree][Sourcetree] as a GUI to begin using BitBucket to learn subversioning(?).  I will soon be testing out bootstrap to create a sort of portfolio. Yo - Bower - Grunt will be assiting in scaffolding out this web app. I need to look into why they call it a web app, what is the defining feature to be called an app. I'm learning this Yeoman stack as well, so this is mostly all new besides editing the HTML/CSS/JS. So this will be a learning experience. And so far this is just for me to look at.
