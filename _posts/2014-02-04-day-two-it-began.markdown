I 'deployed' this site today to [http://www.claybinion.com][0]. It was a lot simpler than I was anticipating. I was a little worried, since I've been using the 'jekyll serve' command from the cmd prompt to view/test the site up until this point. Not really knowing what it's doing, I figured some sort of service was running as a webserver, but wasn't sure if there was another service, uhh serving, the html files and rendering the [Liquid][1] code. 

It seems 'jekyll build' command do what seems obvious now, but wasn't yesterday. It builds the static pages from what's in the _posts, sub folders while templating out from the _layouts folder. I'm guessing the build command uses the [Liquid templating language][1], and uses .html files from _layouts to template out the pages and post layout. This isn't really fact, just all my perception from my testing and reading.

I've used [GitHub][3], along with their stupidly simple [GUI desktop application][4], to create a repository containg the source code for this site. I plan to use [this][2] tutorial/book to begin the process of version control and source code management. I will be using this site as my guinea pig on this venture. This is very long over due, really sort of ridiculous nothing of the sort is in place at work.
