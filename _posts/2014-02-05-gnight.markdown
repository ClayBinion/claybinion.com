Added some styling. Background colors and alignment and whatnot. Very simple CSS and divs. Tomorrow may be some more styling.  Designing is not my strong point, and I should probably work on that. 

Didn't work too much on the site tonight, got distracted watching [this][0] for whatever reason. It had some interesting thoughts I could take very, even though I would not call myself anything near a Javascript developer. I was led to this video by this seemingly comprehensive list of [Front-End Dev Bookmarks][1].

Also I figured I don't have to commit after every minor up date, so I'll just commit at the end of the night. This isn't a very important, version senstive type of project, so it should do no harm. Learnin' as I'm goin'.

I'm not staying up late doing this again. Even though it's already pretty late.
